        "Online gaming may come with various positives and negatives, and one of the topics we will be discussing today is online gaming relationships. “What are online relationships?!” I hear some of you asking. Online relationships are relationships we have online, yes, you can thank me later <3.
    </p>

        The thought of online relationships might scare a few (which is understandable), but there are many positive aspects of an online relationship. You can truly connect with those you play with, and you won’t have to hide who you are because of some prejudice that exists irl. Many people will look at online relationships with disdain, but that doesn’t mean that it is a bad thing. Online relationships can come in many forms, but the one we may associate it with the most is partnership. Though we may imagine online relationships to be only that of the romantic kind, doesn’t mean that there are no others. We have platonic relationships, companionships, and other various relationships one might have while online. Perhaps there is someone online you consider your own sibling, or someone you see as a father figure. It takes time and effort to cultivate such relationships online, perhaps it takes even more effort to grow a relationship online than in real life.

        A thought occurred to me once while I was playing a game. Many players feel like they can say anything they want over the internet; they do this because there are no real repercussions for their doing. Though this may lead to a lot of people speaking without their usual filter, it also may lead those listening to get to know their real character. If you think about it, we simply pretend to be someone who we aren’t to fit into societal norms, but when we’re online, that which binds us to that is released and we get to be who we truly are. If that is a good or a bad thing, it depends on the person.

        Although what I`ve said so far is by far quite positive, does not mean that every gaming session will end well. There are many dangers that lurks within the games your children play every day. We have predators and stalkers, bullies and bad influences. These people live by exploiting others, be it by scamming them of their wealth or having them doxx themselves. In the end, the other party will have leverage over you or your children and might force you to do irreversible things.

        One way to avoid such an outcome is to speak with your children about this. It may come as a surprise to some of you, but children can learn! Teach them of the dangers of the internet through small talks or presentations but do it repeatedly. Research has showed that young children have the capability to learn the 4–7-month mark (this is stated from memory, take this with a grain of salt). By teaching your children early of the dark side of the internet, the easier it is for them to spot and deal with the danger within the games they play.

        In the end, there are both the pros and cons to look at. There is no sure-fire way to protect your children in real life or in game, so just allow your child to be happy, and perhaps monitor what they play occasionally."
